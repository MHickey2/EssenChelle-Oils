# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The EssenChelle Oils site is my 5th Project for the Code Institute and it ia full stack Ecommerce site using the Django Framework and using Python, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap5 and it utilizes Stripe payments.
It includes user authentication and Full CRUD functionality for the products. The website is an ecommerce site dealing with the sale of essential oils and accessories, but the website has been built for project purposes only and the payment transactions are purely for demonstration only.

## 4. Design  <a name="design"></a> 

<br/>

### 1. Colour  Scheme  <a name="colourscheme"></a>

The colour scheme was inspired by essential oils, in particular lavender oil, so the website is based on lavender hues.

</p>
<br/> 

### 2. Typography    <a name="typography"></a>

Google Fonts were used within the website. The 'Roboto' font is the main font used for the whole project, both for regular text and headings. Sans serif is the fallback font in case the other font is not available. See below for example of font in use on the site. The font color is #313131, which is a good font to help counter eye strain.

### 3. Imagery    <a name="imagery"></a>

The Logo was created with [LogoMaker](https://www.logomaker.com/), as the theme was health related, I used predominantly green in the logo iteself and the logo had a strong influence on the overall website colour scheme going forward.

The imagery of the site focuses on essential oils and their byproducts, the images were sourced from the Pexels site and supplement the content. The images for the site are hosted in [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). I had used AWS for a while but was not comfortable using aws, as it was unpredictable in regards to pricing, and chose to revert to cloudinary as I trusted this platform, but am currently using AWS for the static files.

There are also images sporadically placed throughout the site, There is a background image which highlights the nature of the site on the index page, the product was initially a template with no packaging, so I used it in photoshop to apply the packaging for the different products in the essential and massage oil range. The aromatherapy burners were sourced on a shopping site platorm, as it did not have to have the essenchelle branding.

There are also various icons used within the site, the icons were sourced at [Iconify.Design](https://iconify.design/) and font-awesome in some cases, and they were used as a graphical representation for pertinent information on the site, they were used in conjunction with Forms or headings and were a subtle way to incorporate imagery on a limited scale, examples can be found in the image below.

I also created the favicon for the site with [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io)

### 4. Website Structure    <a name="structure"></a>

The website follows the standard website structure. The Logo and the website name are on the left hand side, and the naigation to the right, on the top of all pages. Within the Account Nav Link the user can either Signup or login to the site. When the user logs in they can see the Profile link and the logout button. The logged in user's image will also be visible. When the website is on smaller screens, there is a hamburger meu, with dropdown navigation items. The footer element is also available on all pages, with site information, contact details and social media icons.
