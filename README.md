# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The EssenChelle Oils site is my 5th Project for the Code Institute and it ia full stack Ecommerce site using the Django Framework and using Python, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap5 and it utilizes Stripe payments.
It includes user authentication and Full CRUD functionality for the products. The website is an ecommerce site dealing with the sale of essential oils and accessories, but the website has been built for project purposes only and the payment transactions are purely for demonstration only.

## 4. Design  <a name="design"></a> 

<br/>

### 1. Colour  Scheme  <a name="colourscheme"></a>

The colour scheme was inspired by essential oils, in particular lavender oil, so the website is based on lavender hues.

<br>
<p align ="center">      
   <img src="assets/readme/images/"  alt="Colour Combo" />        
</p>
<p align ="center">      
       
</p>
<br/> 

### 2. Typography    <a name="typography"></a>

Google Fonts were used within the website. The 'Roboto' font is the main font used for the whole project, both for regular text and headings. Sans serif is the fallback font in case the other font is not available. See below for example of font in use on the site. The font color is #313131, which is a good font to help counter eye strain.

font stuff here

<br>

<p align ="center">      
   <img src="assets/readme/images/"  alt="" />        
</p>


<br>

### 3. Imagery    <a name="imagery"></a>

The Logo was created with [LogoMaker](https://www.logomaker.com/), as the theme was health related, I used predominantly green in the logo iteself and the logo had a strong influence on the overall website colour scheme going forward.

The imagery of the site focuses on essential oils and their byproducts, the images were sourced from the Pexels site and supplement the content. The images for the site are hosted in [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). I had used AWS for a while but was not comfortable using aws, as it was unpredictable in regards to pricing, and chose to revert to cloudinary as I trusted this platform, but am currently using AWS for the static files.

There are also images sporadically placed throughout the site, There is a background image which highlights the nature of the site on the index page, the product was initially a template with no packaging, so I used it in photoshop to apply the packaging for the different products in the essential and massage oil range. The aromatherapy burners were sourced on a shopping site platorm, as it did not have to have the essenchelle branding.

There are also various icons used within the site, the icons were sourced at [Iconify.Design](https://iconify.design/) and font-awesome in some cases, and they were used as a graphical representation for pertinent information on the site, they were used in conjunction with Forms or headings and were a subtle way to incorporate imagery on a limited scale, examples can be found in the image below.

I also created the favicon for the site with [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io)

<br>

<p align ="center">

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/images/" width="600" alt="Icons for Site"/>
</p>

<br>

### 4. Website Structure    <a name="structure"></a>

The website follows the standard website structure. The Logo and the website name are on the left hand side, and the naigation to the right, on the top of all pages. Within the Account Nav Link the user can either Signup or login to the site. When the user logs in they can see the Profile link and the logout button. The logged in user's image will also be visible. When the website is on smaller screens, there is a hamburger meu, with dropdown navigation items.

### 5. Wireframes    <a name="wireframes"></a>

The Wireframes for the site were created in Figma, I concentrated on the standard websize and the mobile size. The midlevel sizes were generally in keeping with the main websize but just on a smaller scale. The Wireframes can be found below:

     <img src="assets/readme/images/adminpanel.png" width="900" alt="Admin Panel" />    
</p>

<br/> 

### 22. Security Measures  <a name="security"></a>

To ensure security on the site, only logged in users can access certain features on the site. A logged in user can add a product review or comment for a blog in the blog section. A superuser can add, updata and delete products within the admin panel. The superuser also has access to add, edit and delete products within the product pages. The superuser can add, edit and delete blogs in the admin panel but they can also access these capabilities within the blog page. Only the Admin/Superuser can access the admin Panel(would need sign in credentials).The Database URL and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the Database. As I was following the boutique ado walkthrough, I had not realised the secret key was commited in the early stages of the development, after doing my research into the issue and with the advice from CI, I generated a new key, and this was immediately put in the env.py file, making the other key obselete. All secret keys were included in the env.py file. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Tokens are used on all Forms within the App for added protection. All keys needed for the inclusion of AWS, CLoudinary and Stripe were concealed for security purposes.

 ## 11. Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

 The Project used Heroku for deployment. I used GitPod for development within the project and pushed to the GitHub Repository. This in turn updated the Project in Heroku. I used DEBUG = 'DEV' in os.environ, during development and other than when testing, had it configured so that I could work both locally and could also test the deployed Project on an ongoing basis.

 <br>

Github

 ### How to make a local Clone <a name="clone"></a>
1. Navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Click the green Code Button at top right of the repository.
3. Copy the url for the repository.
4. Open Git Bash and Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory.
5. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you previously copied using $ git clone. 
6. Pressing enter will then create your clone.  

<br/>  


### How to fork a GitHub Repository <a name="fork"></a>
1. Log into GitHub and go to the required Repository.
2. The Fork button is found at the top right corner of the page.
3. When you click this button you will have a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.  


<br> 

More information is available at [https://docs.github.com/en](https://docs.github.com/en), in regards to GitHub and is a great reference point for all GitHub queries.

<br>

Code Institute

 ### Student Template <a name="studenttemplate"></a>
 This Template has been provided by the Code Institute and includes a number of tools to make life easier and has been used within this present site.    

<br/>

### Django Framework    <a name="djangoframework"></a>

I used the Resources and Lessons within the Full Stack Frameworks Module to get familiar with the concepts involved in creating the present Project. In particular I did the walkthroughs for 'Hello Django' and 'I Think Therefore I Blog', and I used the cheatsheet, [Django Blog Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5CWvS5cYalkQOLeQiijpSViDPogtKM7ZGyqK-yehhQ/edit), which helped me set up the basic Django Project. I also looked at the 'Boutique Ado' walkthrough, as when I was creating the profile app, I wanted to see how it was handled within this project, It also helped me solidify some concepts that I had not grasped in the previous walkthrough.

<br>

Heroku

<br>

### Deploying to Heroku <a name="heroku"></a>
- After registering on the Heroku site, you can see the dashboard. You can select 'New' and then click 'Create new app'. You need to pick a unique name for your app, it will let you know if it is  to available to use.
- Select your region and create your app.
- Go to the settings tab and scroll until you find the config vars section and pick 'Reveal config vars',
in this case I added 'PORT' into the key field and added '8000' into the value field and click 'add'.
- If you have credentials, you must create another config vars called 'CREDS' and you would paste the JSON into the value field.
- You have to to the builldpacks section and click 'add buildpack'.
- In this case I added 'Python' and saved changes.
- Next you go to the Deploy tab and you select 'github' and confirm connection to your GitHub Account.
- You search for your project repository and click to 'connect'.
- Under the deploy options, you can chose automatic deploys, this allow you to automatically deploy each
time you push to your Repository. (Option Taken)
- To deploy, you would choose what branch you want to deploy and click on 'Deploy Branch'.
- It takes a little time to build your app but when it is ready you can open your app by using the link provided.

<br>

### Final Deployment 

- When development is complete change the debug setting to: `DEBUG = False` in settings.py
-  In this project the summernote editor was used so for this to work in Heroku, so you need to add: `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = SAMEORIGIN ` to Settings.py.
- In Heroku settings, delete the config vars for `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1` (I had disabled these earlier in the project development)
- You can manually deploy your branch in the deploy section in Heroku, but I had automatic deployment chosen so the Site was updated everytime I pushed to GitHub.

 ## Credits <a name="credits"></a>

 All images on the site were sourced in Pexels, the initial template for the essential oil and massage oil bottles were sourced in freepics. These templates were used in photoshop in combination with a brand created with [LogoMaker](https://www.logomaker.com/) to create customised images with the essenchelle brand, to add authenticity to the website. The Doterra essential oil images were found on the Pexel's site, but they were referenced in the product description.

 The logo and Favicon were built with the online tools: [LogoMaker](https://www.logomaker.com/) and 
 [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)

 he Project began with the basic code used in the 'Boutique Ado' walkthrough Project, but was modified according to my own needs within the Project. As the Project developed, I sought out various Tutorials and consulted documentation for Django.

 I also used the following online resources:

- [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/)
- [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/) 
- [Stack OverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)
- [Card Zoom Hover Effect video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAHjf1Xj0SU)
- [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/)
