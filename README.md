# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The EssenChelle Oils site is my 5th Project for the Code Institute and it is a full stack E-commerce site using the Django Framework and it includes Python, JavaScript, CSS and Bootstrap5. It utilizes Stripe payments. It has user authentication and Full CRUD functionality for the products and Blogs for the Superuser. The website deals with the sale of essential oils and their byproducts. The website would appeal to people who use or want to know more about Essential Oils and are interested in buying these products. This website has been built for educational purposes and the payment transactions are purely for demonstration only. If you want to test the payment functionality, you can use: Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242  Exp: Future Date i.e. 05/25 and CVC can be any 3 numbers.

## 4. Design  <a name="design"></a> 

<br/>

### 1. Colour  Scheme  <a name="colourscheme"></a>

The colour scheme was inspired by essential oils, in particular lavender oil, so the website uses a darker shade of this colour throughout the site. The color Lavender represents holistic wellness and it is known for its tranquility and calming effects. Lavender Oil is also one of the most popular oils and very versatile so it made sense to utilize it's popularity and use a colour most holistic users would be familiar with. The background of the site pages are either white or lavendender where suitable. Headings, borders and the footer are purple. In this project I wanted to only have a subtle use of colour, so that there would be little distraction to the user, when making their purchases on the site.

<br>
<p align ="center">      
   <img src="assets/readme/images/colourcombo.png"  alt="Colour Combo" />
        
</p>
<p align ="center">      
   colors=#800080, #E83E86, #9037E4, #E9AFE9, #2D023D
        
</p>


<br/> 

### 2. Typography    <a name="typography"></a>

Google Fonts were used within the website. The 'Roboto' font is the main font used for the whole project.. Sans serif is the fallback font in case the other font is not available. See below for example of font in use on the site. The font color is #313131, which is a good font to help counter eye strain.

<br>
<p align ="center">      
   <img src="assets/readme/images/313131.png"  alt="general font colour for site" />        
</p>

<br>

The main title for the site, the navigaton items and the headings for the site use the Courgette Font, which is a google font. It is a medium-contrast, brushy, italic-script typeface, which has been made for the web. It adds a decorative flair but is also very legible on a screen. 

<br>

</p>

<br>

<p align ="center">      
   <img src="assets/readme/images/"  alt="" />        
</p>

<br>


### 3. Imagery    <a name="imagery"></a>

The Logo was created with [LogoMaker](https://www.logomaker.com/), I used a health and beauty related theme for the logo, as essential oils are synonymous with health and beauty benefits. The logo features a beautiful woman's face which has the EssenChelle Oil Brand prominant in its design. The colour used fits the colours displayed in the website.

The imagery of the site focuses on essential oils and their byproducts, the images were sourced from the Pexels site and supplement the content. The images for the site are hosted in [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). I had used AWS for a while but was not comfortable using aws, as it was unpredictable in regards to pricing, and I chose to revert to cloudinary as I trusted this platform, from my previous use.

There are also images sporadically placed throughout the site, There is a background image of a massage which highlights the nature of the site on the index page, the product was initially a template with blank packaging detail, so I used photoshop to apply the EssenChelle brand image for the different products in the essential and massage oil range. The aromatherapy burners were sourced on a shopping site platorm, as it did not have to have the essenchelle branding. The Items in the special offer section were also sourced in the Pexels site.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/images/collage.png" width="600" alt="Images for Site"/>
</p>

<br/>

There are also various icons used within the site, the icons were sourced at [Iconify.Design](https://iconify.design/) and font-awesome in some cases, and they were used as a graphical representation for pertinent information on the site, they were used in conjunction with Forms or headings and were a subtle way to incorporate imagery on a limited scale, examples can be found in the image below.

<br>

<p align ="center">      
     <img src="assets/readme/images/icons.png"  alt="icons for Site" />    
</p>

<br/>

I also created the favicon for the site with [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io)

<br>

## 5. Web Marketing

<br>

### 1. E-Commerce Application Type
EssenChelle Oil is a B2C E-Commerce Application. It deal with seling directly to its customer. There is a great emphasis in promoting a good user experience for the customer. The aim is to retain current customers and at the same time grow the customer base by organic means. Because it is online it can reach a wide audience and is not dependent on location. Overhead and operational costs are reduced because there is no physical premises. The Direct to consumer business model has the advantage of being able to charge lower prices, which is a great incentive for customers. The business can run 24 hours a day and this allows flexibility for the business owner as they are not confined to normal business hours.

<br>

### 2. Marketing Strategy
Essenchelle Oils is a fledgling company, with a limited budget for marketing, so decisions need to be cost effective and practical. That being said the company has come up with a range of marketing strategies, ie content marketing, utilizing social media platforms, digital promotions, and highlighting events that will promote the products firsthand. The goal is is to increase project sales, create a following online and concentrate on building brand awareness.

<br>

Social Media will play a big part in the marketing strategy, research into the different platforms has highligted ways that can be cost effective and easy to implement. Facebook is a great way to build up followers and share information with a wide number of customers. A Facebook page was created to share pertinent information with the users, and will be used to promote the latest deals, that should entice new customers to the EssenChelle site. The image below shows the Facebook page, it is active currently but not sure if it will remain so, so have included screencapture below and here is the link: [EssenChelle Oils](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090771283240)

#### **Facebook Page**

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/images/facebookpage.jpg" alt="EssenChelle Facebook Page" />
</p>

<br>

Content Marketing: the process of publishing written and visual material online with the purpose of attracting more leads to your business is the essence of content marketing. In this case the website has a blog section which highlighs the products in the EssenChelle range. The main focus is on showing the customer the benefits of specific oils to the customers, why they should buy them and how they can use them. This should drive more sales and funnel the user to the products page. Selected blogs can also be shared on various social media channels, furthering the reach of the created content.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/images/blogposts.png" alt="Blog Section" />
</p>

<br>

Google Ads : This option is out of reach at the moment, as the budget is small, but with enough experience and analysis I hope to be able to plan a campaign in the future that will be cost effective and will pay long lasting dividents.

<br>

Events: There is a large industry dealing with essential oils and aromatherapy in Ireland, and indeed worldwide. In this regard you can tap into existing events that are used to promote the industry and that are very accessible to the public. One of the largest event, occurs yearly in the RDS in the Body Mind Spirit fair where a range of companies, mostly smaller companies have the opportunity to highlight their products to a very involved and motivated audience. You have the opporuity to mingle with and sell directly to the public and grow a valuable network which will be a great boost for future business. This would play a major part in growing the brand and linking with a potentially large customer base. But this occurs later in the year, and meantime smaller events, in this vein are held in venues throughtout the country and would be an excellent way to connect with the right clientele. As well as growing a customer base it wold be good to network with other business's and there may be some mutual gains in forging such alliances. The image below shows the Expo details:

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/images/bodymindspirit.png" width="700" alt="Body Mind Spirit Expo" />
</p>

<br>

The website itself offers users the chance to sign up for a regular newsletter. This measure allows you communicate directly with your prospects and customers in a personalized way by serving valuable content and relevant promotions straight to their inboxes. This newsletter would be a good way to promote new products, provide articles highlighting the benefits of using certain products, offer special offers and highlight new arrival products. This will be a great way to grow the Essenchelle community and keep the customers in the loop. The newsletter functionality utilizes mailchimp, this service will help keep track of users. Mailchimp offers a number of tools that will be explored further as the company develops.

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/images/newsletter.png" alt="Mailchimp Newsletter" />
</p>

<br>


###  3. Search Engine Optimization(SEO)
SEO research will help drive pople to our site more efficiently. Inititally finding the right keywords will help send our site further up in the rankings. Finding the right words involved looking at present sites, previous research finding and analysing which words were suggested when searching for essential oils and aromatherapy in particular. I used [wordtracker.com](https://www.wordtracker.com/) and various other free tools to find keywords, the factors that determined the ones chosen include search volume, relevance and conversion value. I then picked the top words and phrases and integrated them into the site via meta-tags or by ensuring they were included in headings, image names and content. It was important not to overdo the use of these words as this would have been counterproductive to the end goal. The following image shows a sample of the results found and used in the site:

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/images/keywordsearches.png" width="700" alt="Keyword Search" />
</p>

<br>

There were also links included for both internal pages and external sites of good standing that are in a similar industry. I have an external link in the blog page in the sidebar, the site is not information heavy so I linked to a reputable site, that had more detailed information on safety precautions. The site used can be found [here](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/what-are-essential-oils-a-complete-guide-on-aromatherapy-and-its-potential-health-benefits/) 

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/images/externallinksite.png"  width="600" alt="External Site on Health and Benefits" />
</p>

<br>

### 4. XML Sitemap
Additionally to help the search engines crawl the site, I've added an XML sitemap file to the main root directory. This was generated using [xml-sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/)

<br>

### 5. Robots.Txt File
A robots.txt file has also added to allow the search engine crawlers to know which URLs the crawler can access on this ste, this was used mainly to avoid overloading the site with requests.

<br>

## 6. Features  <a name="features"></a>

There are features common to all pages in the site and these are found in the base.html page. These include:

- The Logo and Site Title:
  
The logo was the first asset I created in Logo maker, it depicts a simple female face image using the main colours displayed in the site. The Logo includes the name of the site, so the logo is synonomous with the brand. Using the name in the logo meant I had a readymade image for the packaging of the products in the range. The image relates to the area of health and Beauty, as essential oils are strongly related to the promotion of health and beauty benefits.

### 26. Security Measures  <a name="security"></a>

To ensure security on the site, only logged in users can access certain features on the site. A logged in user can add a product review or comment for a blog in the blog section. A superuser can add, updata and delete products within the admin panel. The superuser also has access to add, edit and delete products within the product pages. The superuser can add, edit and delete blogs in the admin panel but they can also access these capabilities within the blog page. Only the Admin/Superuser can access the admin Panel(would need sign in credentials).The Database URL and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the Database. As I was following the boutique ado walkthrough, I had not realised the secret key was commited in the early stages of the development, after doing my research into the issue and with the advice from CI, I generated a new key, and this was immediately put in the env.py file, making the other key obselete. All secret keys were included in the env.py file. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Tokens are used on all Forms within the App for added protection. All keys needed for the inclusion of AWS, CLoudinary and Stripe were concealed for security purposes.

 ## 7. Future Implementation  <a name="future"></a>

 <br>

 This is my first E-Commerce Site, so the main goal is to have a fully functional site with customised models to expand on the original concept as defined in the Boutique Ado Walkthrough. There were a number of features that I would like to expand upon in the future.

 In relation to the products, I would like to expand the information relating to the product. Besides the description, I would ike to include directions for use and cautions. You could also sort products according to the health conditions that can be addressed by using them i.e. insomnia, anxiety, respiratory issues.

 In regards to the blogs I have just added a few basic blogs, with heavy emphasis on product spotlighting for marketing purposes. These blogs could also be broken down into further categories. I could add a do it yourself section, where you could provide simple instructions for users to use the products in creative ways, this is incorporated into the present blog in a small way, but would be a great way for users to learn to integrate the products into their lives. I would also include a recipe category where you could provide the user with recipes using the essential oils. This could be a good way to get users to interact with the site. you could ask the users to contribute their own recipes via the social media channels or by contacting the company directly with the contact form. User's recipes could then be featured on the site. Healthy Living could also be a category and you could give advice on how to use oils in the home and provide tips for everyday living in relation to EssenChelle Oils. These measures should not only drive sales, but should help to create a a thriving community with a shared interest in essential oil and their byproducts.

 In regard to the profiles, I would customise it more for the user, in the previous project I had an image for the profile user, but would rather ensure I meet all the project criteria first, and if there is time at the end I could explore this possibility, but would hope to introduce this in a future iteration.

 In regard to the review, I had looked into the idea of using the ratings in the reviews in the product rating, again this is still a possibility, but time restraints this may not make this possible at this time. It would be easier at this time to use existing ratings, as it would take time to generate actual ratings and with this restraint new products would not have any rating, and this would not be ideal. i

 In regards to logging in, I would also include logging in from a social network provider like Facebook, Twitter, or Google to facilitate the user further.

 In regards to deals I would introduce deals to encourage the user to buy multiple products at a special rate, from a marketing perspective I feel this would be conducive to more sales. In the long term I would also introduce a loyalty scheme, so that users would be rewarded for their consumer buying behaviour.

 ## 10. Bugs and Issues  <a name="bugs"></a>

 There have been a number of issues during development. Initially there was major issues with images, both sourcing assets and resizing them so they are uniform on the site. I wanted the products to carry the brand of the site, so this meant they had to be customised within photoshop. The special offer section are different in that they have a coloured background, but the sizing is the same, so I could live with that.

 
<br>

 ### Resolved <a name="resolved"></a>

 The webhooks were problematic at times mostly in relation to the URLS for the endpoints and making sure the secret keys are in place and the endpoint is activated on the stripe dashboard. Without being able to test with the testhooks earlier it was hard to know why they are not working and how to fix them when they were not working. Again when the project is deploayed going through this procedure again and testing a seperate endpoint. I had thought I had kept the code close to the stripe code in the walkthrough project but did have an issue with the code, I had added an extra return which meant although the order was processing correctly it never triggered the success page or the confirmation email after an order was processed and needed help from tutor support to resolved the issue, which was done with a series of print statements. There was at the same time an issue with an extra blank line in the header of the confirmation_email_subject, when these issues were fixed I finally managed to get the email message confirmation printing in the terminal within gitpod and I received email confirmation with the deployed site.

 There has been an issue with the webhooks in the gitpod site, the address has changed, which means I have been having to update the webhook url at times, when it stops working I review the address, and it usually has just changed by one number, and when it is updated it works ok again, not sure if I can prevent this happening again, but am looking into it. The Heroku webhook has no such problems, so the checkout should work as normal after submission.

 I had an issue when updating the quantity selector so it works on both the desktop and mobile screens, for this I just used the fix advised during the walkthrough video, and although I updated the 3 files, it did not work, used the code diff application and found no difference, but it still did not work, so I got on to tutor support and explaied the issue, by the means of print statements, the problem was found in the script on the bag page, while updating the dollor signs to the euro signs throughout the site, when I wanted the currency to show euros instead of dollars, I had mistakenly added a euro in a query instead of the required dollor, so this had caused a 500 error, which displayed in the termnal, when this was replaced, it started to work as it was supposed to.

 <br>

 ### Unresolved <a name="unresolved"></a>

 There is an issue in regards to sizes of products at the moment you will be offered different sizes within cerain products, which you can select successfully, there is an issue with applying 2 different prices to seperate sizes of the one product, which would need to be addressed. You can have either a small or large essential oil product in some items, but currently both products will be riced the same, now I could content the smaller bottle is of a higher quality and the larger bottle is a weaker solution and this could account for the pricing, but moving forward I would add additional functionality to offer a greater range of sizes for a greater range of products with a differing range of costs.  I really didnt want to deviate too much from the existing scripts, as I felt this might have a detrimental effect on the whole buying procedure and the inclusion of the Stripe functioning, but this would be an area that would need more of a deep dive for building E-Commerce sites in the future.

 ## 11. Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

 The Project used Heroku for deployment. I used GitPod for development within the project and pushed to the GitHub Repository. This in turn updated the Project in Heroku. I used DEBUG = 'DEV' in os.environ, during development and other than when testing, had it configured so that I could work both locally and could also test the deployed Project on an ongoing basis. I added all the config vars for Stripe, AWS, The Database URL, and the creds for email. I had originally has disable collectstatic and the creds for AWS but removed these when I added cloudinary.

 ### Student Template <a name="studenttemplate"></a>
 This Template has been provided by the Code Institute and includes a number of tools to make life easier and has been used within this present site.

### Django Framework    <a name="djangoframework"></a>

I used the Resources and Lessons within the Building an E-Commerce Module to get familiar with the concepts involved in building an Ecommerce site. In particular I did the walkthroughs for 'Boutique Ado' and I covered the E-Commerce Application types, Introduction to Search Engine Optimization and Web Marketing Modules. I also referred back to my previous project and the 'I think therefore I blog' walkthrough. I also referred to the Django documentation for the occasional query.

<br>

Heroku

<br>

### Deploying to Heroku <a name="heroku"></a>
- After registering on the Heroku site, you can see the dashboard. You can select 'New' and then click 'Create new app'. You need to pick a unique name for your app, it will let you know if it is  to available to use.
- Select your region and create your app.
- Go to the settings tab and scroll until you find the config vars section and pick 'Reveal config vars',
in this case I added 'PORT' into the key field and added '8000' into the value field and click 'add'.
- If you have credentials, you must create another config vars called 'CREDS' and you would paste the JSON into the value field.
- You have to to the builldpacks section and click 'add buildpack'.
- In this case I added 'Python' and saved changes.
- Next you go to the Deploy tab and you select 'github' and confirm connection to your GitHub Account.
- You search for your project repository and click to 'connect'.
- Under the deploy options, you can chose automatic deploys, this allow you to automatically deploy each
time you push to your Repository or you can manually deploy which is the option I opted for.
- To deploy, you would choose what branch you want to deploy and click on 'Deploy Branch'.
- It takes a little time to build your app but when it is ready you can open your app by using the link provided.

### Changes in Heroku  <a name="herokuchanges"></a>

 Because of the changes in Heroku I used Eco Dynos and used ElephantSQL instead of the postgres database which is offered by Heroku. To ensure this was done successfully, I followed the same procedure as I had used in the prior project and referred to the following documents.

[Sign up for ElephantSQL](https://code-institute-students.github.io/deployment-docs/02-elephantsql/elephantsql-01-sign-up)
  
[Migrating Databases](https://code-institute-students.github.io/deployment-docs/80-migrating-databases-for-heroku/)
 
[Changing Dynos](https://code-institute-students.github.io/deployment-docs/01-heroku-signup/heroku-03-converting-dynos) 

<br>

### Final Deployment 

- When development is complete change the debug setting to: `DEBUG = False` in settings.py
-  In this project the summernote editor was used so for this to work in Heroku, you needed to add: `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = SAMEORIGIN ` to Settings.py.
- In Heroku settings, delete the config vars for `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1`, when I was using AWS, I used 2 different settings for gitpod and for the deployed site, to ensure costs were kept low, but nearer the end of the project when I was not using AWS, I did not worry as much about deploying.
- I had automatic deployment chosen originally, but changed this to manual deployment, as I deployed less in this project to keep costs low on AWS.

 ## Credits <a name="credits"></a>

 All images on the site were sourced in Pexels, the initial template for the essential oil and massage oil bottles were sourced in freepics. These templates were used in photoshop in combination with a brand created with [LogoMaker](https://www.logomaker.com/) to create customised images with the essenchelle brand, to add authenticity to the website. The Doterra essential oil images were found on the Pexel's site, but they were referenced in the product description.

 The logo and Favicon were built with the online tools: [LogoMaker](https://www.logomaker.com/) and 
 [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)

 he Project began with the basic code used in the 'Boutique Ado' walkthrough Project, but was modified according to my own needs within the Project. As the Project developed, I sought out various Tutorials and consulted documentation for Django and Stripe.

 I also used the following online resources:

- [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/)
- [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/) 
- [Stack OverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)
