# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The EssenChelle Oils site is my 5th Project for the Code Institute and it is a full stack E-commerce site using the Django Framework and it includes Python, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap5 and it utilizes Stripe payments. It has user authentication and Full CRUD functionality for the products and Blogs. The website deals with the sale of essential oils and their byproducts. The webiste would appeal to people who use or want to know more about Essential Oils. This website has been built for educational purposes and the payment transactions are purely for demonstration only.

## 4. Design  <a name="design"></a> 

<br/>

### 1. Colour  Scheme  <a name="colourscheme"></a>

The colour scheme was inspired by essential oils, in particular lavender oil, so the website uses this colour throughout the site. The color Lavender represents holistic wellness and it is known for its tranquility and calming effects. Lavender Oil is also one of the most popular oils and very versatile so it made sense to utilize it's popularity and use a colour most holistic users would be familiar with. There is not a lot of colour and the backgrounds are either white or lavendender where suitable. Headings, borders and the footer are purple. In this project I wanted to only have a subtle use of colour, so that there would be little distraction to the user, when making their purchases on the site.

<br>

   <img src="assets/readme/images/"  alt="Colour Combo" />        
</p>
<p align ="center">      
       
</p>
<br/> 

### 2. Typography    <a name="typography"></a>

Google Fonts were used within the website. The 'Roboto' font is the main font used for the whole project, both for regular text and headings. Sans serif is the fallback font in case the other font is not available. See below for example of font in use on the site. The font color is #313131, which is a good font to help counter eye strain.

</p>


<br>

### 3. Imagery    <a name="imagery"></a>

The Logo was created with [LogoMaker](https://www.logomaker.com/), as the theme was health related, I used predominantly green in the logo iteself and the logo had a strong influence on the overall website colour scheme going forward.

The imagery of the site focuses on essential oils and their byproducts, the images were sourced from the Pexels site and supplement the content. The images for the site are hosted in [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). I had used AWS for a while but was not comfortable using aws, as it was unpredictable in regards to pricing, and chose to revert to cloudinary as I trusted this platform.

There are also images sporadically placed throughout the site, There is a background image which highlights the nature of the site on the index page, the product was initially a template with no packaging, so I used it in photoshop to apply the packaging for the different products in the essential and massage oil range. The aromatherapy burners were sourced on a shopping site platorm, as it did not have to have the essenchelle branding.

There are also various icons used within the site, the icons were sourced at [Iconify.Design](https://iconify.design/) and font-awesome in some cases, and they were used as a graphical representation for pertinent information on the site, they were used in conjunction with Forms or headings and were a subtle way to incorporate imagery on a limited scale, examples can be found in the image below.

I also created the favicon for the site with [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io)

### 4. Website Structure    <a name="structure"></a>

## Web Marketing

### 1. E-Commerce Application Type
EssenChelle Oil is a B2C E-Commerce Application. It deal with seling directly to its customer. There is a great emphasis in promoting a good user experience for the customer. The aim is to retain current customers and at the same time grow the customer base by organic means. 

### 2. Marketing Strategy
Essenchelle Oils is a fledgling company, with a limited budget for marketing, so decisions need to be cost effective and practical. That being said the company has come up with a range of marketing strategies, ie content marketing, utilizing social media platforms, digital promotions, and highlighting events that will promote the products firsthand. The goal is is to increase project sales, create a following online and concentrate on building brand awareness.

Social Media will play a big part in the marketing strategy, research into the different platforms has highligted ways that can be cost effective and easy to implement. Facebook is a great way to fuild up followers and share information with a wide range of customers. A Facebook page was created to share pertinent information with the users, and promotes the latest great deal, that should entice new customers to the EssenChelle site. The image below shows the Facebook page [EssenChelle Oils]().

Google Ads : This option is out of reach at the moment, as the budget is small, but with enough experience and analysis I hope to be able to plan a campaign in the future that will be cost effective and will earn results.

There is a large industry dealing with essesntial oils and aromatherapy in Irelan, and indeed worldwide. In this regard you can tap into existing events that are used to promote the industry and that are very accessible to the public. One of the largest event, occurs yearly in the RDS in the Body Mind Spirit fair where a range of companies, mostly smaller companies have the opportunity to highlight their products to a very involved and motivated audience. You have the opporuity to mingle with and sell directly to the public and grow a valuable network which will pay dividents for future business. This would play a major
part in growing the brand and linking with a potentially large customer base. But this occurs later in the year, and meantime smaller events, in this vein are held in venues throughtout the country and would be an excellent way to connect with the right clientele. As well as growing a customer base it wold be good to network with other business's and there may be some mutual gains in forging such alliances.

The website itself offers users the chance to sign up for a regular newsletter. This newsletter would be a good way to promote new products, provide articles which highlight the benefits of using certain products, offer special offers and highlight new arrival products. This will be a great way to grow the Essenchelle community and keep the customers in the loop. The newsletter functionality utilizes mailchimp, who will keep track of users and with their extensive capabilities, the company would seek to utilize more of their services in the future.


###  3. Search Engine Optimization(SEO)
SEO research will help drive pople to our site more efficiently. Inititally finding the right keywords will help send our site further up in the rankings. Finding the right words involved looking at present sites, previous research finding and analysing which words were suggested when searching for essential oils and aromatherapy in particular. I then picked the top words ad phrased and ensured they were integrated into the site via meta-tags or by ensuring they were included in headings, image names and content. There were also links included for bother internal pages and external sites of good standing that are in a similar industry.


### 4. XML Sitemap
Additionally to help the search engines crawl the site, I've added an XML sitemap file to the main root directory. 

A robots.txt file has also added to indicate to the search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on this ste, used mainly to avoid overloading the site with requests.

There are features common to all pages in the site and these are found in the base.html page. These include:

The logo was the first asset I created in Logo maker it depicts a simple female image with the main colours displayed in the site.

The image relates to the area of health and Beauty, as essential oils are strongly related to the promotion of health and beauty benefits.

### 26. Security Measures  <a name="security"></a>

To ensure security on the site, only logged in users can access certain features on the site. A logged in user can add a product review or comment for a blog in the blog section. A superuser can add, updata and delete products within the admin panel. The superuser also has access to add, edit and delete products within the product pages. The superuser can add, edit and delete blogs in the admin panel but they can also access these capabilities within the blog page. Only the Admin/Superuser can access the admin Panel(would need sign in credentials).The Database URL and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the Database. As I was following the boutique ado walkthrough, I had not realised the secret key was commited in the early stages of the development, after doing my research into the issue and with the advice from CI, I generated a new key, and this was immediately put in the env.py file, making the other key obselete. All secret keys were included in the env.py file. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Tokens are used on all Forms within the App for added protection. All keys needed for the inclusion of AWS, CLoudinary and Stripe were concealed for security purposes.

 ## 7. Future Implementation  <a name="future"></a>

 <br>

 This is my first E-Commerce Site, so the main goal is to have a fully functional site with customised models to expand on the original concept as defined in the Boutique Ado Walkthrough. There were a number of features that I would like to expand upon in the future.

 In relation to the products, I would like to expand the information relating to the product. Besides the description, I would ike to include directions for use and cautions. You could also sort products according to the health conditions that can be addressed by using them i.e. insomnia, anxiety, respiratory issues.

 In regards to the blogs I have just added a few basic blogs, with heavy emphasis on product spotlighting for marketing purposes. These blogs could also be broken down into further categories, outside fo this remit. You can add a do it yourself section, where you could provide simple instructions for users to use the products in creative ways, this is incorporated into the present blog in a small way, but would be a great way for users to learn to integrate the products into their lives. I would also include a recipe category where you could provide the user with recipes using the essential oils. This could be a good way to get users to interact with the site. you could ask the users to contribute their own recipes via the social media channels or by contacting the company directly with the contact form. User's recipes could then be featured on the site. Healthy Living could also be a category and you could give advice on how to use oils in the home and provide tips for everyday living in relation to EssenChelle Oils. These measures should not only drive sales, but should create a a thriving community with a shared interest in essential oil and their byproducts.

 In regard to the profiles, I would customise it more for the user, in the previous project I had an image for the profile user, but would rather ensure I meet all the project criteria first, and if there is time at the end I could explore this possibility, but if not will introduce this in a future iteration.

 In regard to the review, I had looked into the idea of using the ratings in the reviews in the product rating, again this is still a possibility, but time restraints this may not be possible at this time.

 ## 10. Bugs and Issues  <a name="bugs"></a>

 There have been a number of issues during development. Initially there was major issues with images, both sourcing assets and resizing them so they are uniform on the site. I wanted the products to carry the brand of the site, so this meant they had to be customised within photoshop. The special offer section are different in that they have a coloured background, but the sizing is the same, so I could live with that.

 ## 11. Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

 The Project used Heroku for deployment. I used GitPod for development within the project and pushed to the GitHub Repository. This in turn updated the Project in Heroku. I used DEBUG = 'DEV' in os.environ, during development and other than when testing, had it configured so that I could work both locally and could also test the deployed Project on an ongoing basis.

 <br>

Github

 ### How to make a local Clone <a name="clone"></a>

<br> 

More information is available at [https://docs.github.com/en](https://docs.github.com/en), in regards to GitHub and is a great reference point for all GitHub queries.

<br>

Code Institute

 ### Student Template <a name="studenttemplate"></a>
 This Template has been provided by the Code Institute and includes a number of tools to make life easier and has been used within this present site.    

<br/>

### Django Framework    <a name="djangoframework"></a>

I used the Resources and Lessons within the Full Stack Frameworks Module to get familiar with the concepts involved in creating the present Project. In particular I did the walkthroughs for 'Hello Django' and 'I Think Therefore I Blog', and I used the cheatsheet, [Django Blog Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5CWvS5cYalkQOLeQiijpSViDPogtKM7ZGyqK-yehhQ/edit), which helped me set up the basic Django Project. I also looked at the 'Boutique Ado' walkthrough, as when I was creating the profile app, I wanted to see how it was handled within this project, It also helped me solidify some concepts that I had not grasped in the previous walkthrough.

<br>

Heroku

<br>

### Deploying to Heroku <a name="heroku"></a>
- After registering on the Heroku site, you can see the dashboard. You can select 'New' and then click 'Create new app'. You need to pick a unique name for your app, it will let you know if it is  to available to use.
- Select your region and create your app.
- Go to the settings tab and scroll until you find the config vars section and pick 'Reveal config vars',
in this case I added 'PORT' into the key field and added '8000' into the value field and click 'add'.
- If you have credentials, you must create another config vars called 'CREDS' and you would paste the JSON into the value field.
- You have to to the builldpacks section and click 'add buildpack'.
- In this case I added 'Python' and saved changes.
- Next you go to the Deploy tab and you select 'github' and confirm connection to your GitHub Account.
- You search for your project repository and click to 'connect'.
- Under the deploy options, you can chose automatic deploys, this allow you to automatically deploy each
time you push to your Repository. (Option Taken)
- To deploy, you would choose what branch you want to deploy and click on 'Deploy Branch'.
- It takes a little time to build your app but when it is ready you can open your app by using the link provided.

<br>

### Final Deployment 

- When development is complete change the debug setting to: `DEBUG = False` in settings.py
-  In this project the summernote editor was used so for this to work in Heroku, so you need to add: `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = SAMEORIGIN ` to Settings.py.
- In Heroku settings, delete the config vars for `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1` (I had disabled these earlier in the project development)
- You can manually deploy your branch in the deploy section in Heroku, but I had automatic deployment chosen so the Site was updated everytime I pushed to GitHub.

 All images on the site were sourced in Pexels, the initial template for the essential oil and massage oil bottles were sourced in freepics. These templates were used in photoshop in combination with a brand created with [LogoMaker](https://www.logomaker.com/) to create customised images with the essenchelle brand, to add authenticity to the website. The Doterra essential oil images were found on the Pexel's site, but they were referenced in the product description.

 The logo and Favicon were built with the online tools: [LogoMaker](https://www.logomaker.com/) and 
 [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)

 he Project began with the basic code used in the 'Boutique Ado' walkthrough Project, but was modified according to my own needs within the Project. As the Project developed, I sought out various Tutorials and consulted documentation for Django.

 I also used the following online resources:

- [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/)
- [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/) 
- [Stack OverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com)
