# EssenChelle Oil: Testing


Back to the [README](README.md)

Testing has taken place continuously throughout the development of the project. When faults were detected they were fixed on an ongoing basis. These were fixed locally in GitPod and committed to GitHub regularly. Faults fixed and outstanding can be found in the README.md Document.

## Responsive Testing<a name="responsivetesting"></a>

   I regularly tested the responsiveness of the site using Google Chrome Developer tools, information on this can be found [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/). I also used Window Resizer and a Responsive Design Tester Application available in the Google Chrome Store. I also used the Am I responsive site to test the site and the image below is from that Testing:

1. Python Validation   <a name="python"></a>
  Python testing was done without the use of Pep8 as the site was down, instead an extension was added which highlighted errors and showed them in the problems panel within gitpod. Most errors during the build related to long lines, which I rectified. I also used [Code Institute Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)
